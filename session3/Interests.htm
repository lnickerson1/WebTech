    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>My top three interests are <a href="#HockeyHeader" target="_blank">Hockey</a>, <a href="#VideoGamesHeader" target="_blank">Video Games</a>, and <a href="#RunningHeader" target="_blank">Running</a>. When I am not doing school or working at the library I am most likely doing one of these three activities.</p>

    <p class="RightFloat">I enjoyed hokcey the most out of all of my interests. However, in my sophmore year of highschool I recieved my sixth concussion. Because of this I can no longer play competitive contact sports. Today I play club, mens league, and pond hockey as much as possible.</p>
