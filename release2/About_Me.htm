        <p>Hello! My name is Logan Nickerson and I am currently a junior at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts. I am studying computational and mathematical finance. At Babson I am an RA, a library supervisor, a captain of the ultimate frisbee club team, and also play on the ice hockey club team. In addition to these, I enjoy Rubik's cubes and other puzzles, video games, and tattoos. This summer I will be partaking in an internship as a financial advisor at The Moody Street Group. After school I intend to continue on the path of financial advising.</p>

        <h2>How did I get here?</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a small town called Gray which is located in the southern part of Maine. Growing up I enjoyed sports very much, participating in track and field, hockey, cross country, baseball, and ultimate frisbee from a very young age all the way through high school. Unfortunately, my goal of a competitive hockey or running career was interrupted by multiple leg injuries that resulted in three major surgeries. As for schooling, I attended a small public highschool but challenged myself with the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. This is where my passion for math really took off.</p>
